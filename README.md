We want to make a chat were clients connect to a server. When a clients sends a message, it provides the message and the user. The Server uses objects to handle the client connection and if a message from a client appears, it sends the message to all clients.

The GUI-Version of the client consists of a window, where all messages can be seen and on the bottom a text-input field.
