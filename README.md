## Documentation
We want to make a chat were clients can connect to a server and send messsages to all users. When a clients sends a message, it provides the message and the user. The Server uses objects to handle the client connection and if a message from a client appears, it sends the message to all clients except to the one who sent it.

The GUI-Version of the client consists of a window, where all messages can be seen and on the bottom a text-input field in order to type in the message which should be sent.

For Communication, we will rely on an Object with a user and the message. For en/decoding we will use pickle. Documentation:

### CLI Client
For a better User Experience, we format the terminal output with colors. We use a 256-color scheme for our CLI client.
